TXT:
Manually reading with file reader (fs).
Probably a better solution available for parsing.
Had a bit of trouble with parsing string "true" into a boolean value of true, etc.
- Doing so with some if's and elses, it ended up skipping the value.
- Most likely lack of knowledge regarding json and js objects.

Library for yaml to json: npm install js-yaml
- As simple as it got.
- Perhaps the exercise was to train low level coding and we should parse it manually 
- - as done with txt file format... ?
